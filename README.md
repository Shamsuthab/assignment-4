Assignment-4

File Organization:
index.html: It has a button to load tasks and a blank `div` where the tasks will appear later.
styles.css: Makes it look more stylish
api.js: This pretends to be a database. It uses a `Promise` and a timer to act slow
taskManager.js: This is where the "logic" is . I used 'ES6 Classes' to show what a "Task" is and a "TaskManager" to hold the list of tasks.
main.js: This is the main file. It connects the buttons in the HTML to the logic in the manager and the data in the API.

Challenges faced:
It was quite hard to make TaskID immutable 
error file commiting was faced
